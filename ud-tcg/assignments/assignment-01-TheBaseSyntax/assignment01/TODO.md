- <del>Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput</del>

- <del>Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there</del>
- <del>Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component</del>
- <del>Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)</del>
- <del>Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event</del>
